	\subsection*{An Approximation Algorithm For Problem $GC^{ \leq s} $}


We consider only ordinary graphs, i.e., the graphs without loops and multiple edges. An ordinary graph is called \textit{cluster graph} it its every connected component is a complete graph [1].
Let $M^{\leq s}(V)$ be the set of all cluster graphs on the set of vertices V, having size of each connected component at most s, $ 2 \leq s \leq |V|$.

If $G_1 = (V,E_1)$ and $G_2 = (V, E_2)$ - ordinary graphs with marked vertices on the same set of vertices V, then \textit{distance} $d(G_1,G_2)$ between they are determined by

$$
d(G_1,G_2) = |E_1\triangle E_2| = |E_1 \ E_2| + |E_2\ E_1|,
$$

i.e. $d(G_1,G_2)$ - the number of not matching edges between graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$.

\textbf{Problem $GC^{\leq s}(V)$} Given n-vertices  graph $G = (V,E)$ and integer s,  $2 \leq s \leq |V|$, find a graph $M^* \in M^{\leq s}(V)$, that

$$
d(G,M^*)= min_{M\in M^{leq s}(V)}d(G,M).
$$

In paper [2] was proofed that problem $GC^{\leq s}$ is NP-hard for all fixed number $s \geq 3$. For problem $GC^{\leq 3}$ in [2] was introduced polynomial approximation algorithm  with possible guarantee accuracy score
$ \lfloor \dfrac{(s-1)^2}{2} \rfloor + 1$. In this work we suggest approximated algorithm with guarantee accuracy score 2s-2 for problem $GC^{\leq 3}$. % Формулировку последнего предложения изменю, после упрощения алгоритма А1

\begin{theorem}
	Let $G=(V,E)$ - arbitrary graph, $p$ - integer $(2 \leq p \leq |V|)$, $M^* = (V_{M^*},E_{M^*})$ is an optimal solution of problem $GC^{\leq p}$ on graph G, $M = (V_M,E_M)$ - cluster graph constructed by algorithm $A_2$. Then
	$$
	\dfrac{d(G,M)}{d(G,M^*)} \leq 2 (s - 1)
	$$
\end{theorem}
\textbf{Proof.}

1) By definition $d(G,M^*) = |E_G \ E_M^*| + |E_M^* \ E_G|$.
Let $E_G \ E_M^* = E_0 \cup E_1$, where:
\\ $E_0$ - set of edges graph $G$ not putted neither $M^*$ nor $M$.
\\ $E_1$ - set of edges graph $G$ not putted in $M^*$, but inserted by algorithm in $M$.
\\ Noted $E_2 = E_M^* \ E_G$. Then $d(G,M*) = |E_0| + |E_1| + |E_2|$.

2) Graph $M$ is a subgraph of graph $G$ by construction, therefore $d(G,M) = |E_G \ E_M|$.
Difference of $E_G \ E_M$ let's imagine in the following form: $E_G \ E_M = E_0\cup E_0\cup \tilde{E}$, $\tilde{E}$ - set of edges graph G not introduced in $M$, but putted  in $M^*$. As edges of set $\tilde{E}$ - is an edges of graph G between clusters (cliques) graph $M$, then any edge of set $\tilde{E}$ has the form $e = uv$, where $v \in K^i$, $u \in K^j$ for some $i,j$, where $ i < j $ (see Step $5$.

3) Show, that any edge from $\tilde{E}$ either adjacent with edge from set $E_1$ in graph $G$, or adjacent with edge from set $E_2$ in graph $M^*$.
Consider arbitrary edge $e = uv$, where $v\in v\in K^i$, $u \in K^j$, $i < j$. As $i < j$, when $u \in V^{'}$ by building of cluster $K^i$ (On Step $1$ iteration $i$). As the same time, the vertex $u$ haven't included in cluster $K^i$. It can be only in two cases:
\\a) $|K^i| = s$. Then $|K^i \cup u| = s + 1$, therefore exist at least one $w \in K^i$ such, that $w$ and $v$ placed in different clusters of graph $M^*$. And since by construction $K^i$ - clique in graph G, that vertices $v$ and $w$ are adjacent in G. Therefore, $vw \in E_1$.
\\b)$|K^i| < s$, but exist $w \in K^i$ such, that $uw \notin E$. Then if $w$ placed in the same cluster of graph $M^*$ as $u$, then $uw\in E_2$. Else if $w$ and $u$ placed if different clusters of graph $M^*$, then vertices $w$ and $v$ also placed in different clusters of graph $M^*$. As case a) we get that $uw \in E_1$.
So, we showed that any edge from $\tilde{E}$ either adjacent with edge from set $E_1$ in $G$ or adjacent with edge from set $E_2$ in $M^*$. Thus $\tilde{E} = \tilde{E}_1 \cup \tilde{E}_2$, where

$$
\tilde{E}_1 = { e = uv \in \tilde{E} | \exists vw\in E_1}, \tilde{E}_2 = {e = uv \in \tilde{E}|\exists uw\in E_2}
$$
(possible, $\tilde{E}_1 \cap \tilde{E}_2 \neq 0$).

4) Note, that for ever edge of graph $G$ from $E_1$ can match not more $2(s-1) = 2s - 4$ adjacent edges of set $\tilde{E}_2$. Therefore:
$$
d(C,M) \leq |E_0| + |\tilde{E}_1| + |\tilde{E}_2| \leq |E_0| + (2s-2)|E_1| + (2s-4)|E_2| \leq |E_0|+(2s-2)(|E_1| + |E_2|).
$$
Therefore,
$$
\frac{d(G,M)}{d(G,M^*)} \leq \frac{|E_0| + (2s-2)(|E_1| + |E_2|)}{|E_0| + |E_1| + |E_2|} \leq \frac{(2s-2)(|E_1|+|E_2|)}{|E_1| + |E_2|} = 2(s-1).
$$
The theorem is proved.

How showing next note, evaluation of (1) is achievable.

\begin{observation}
	For all $s\geq 3$ exists such graph $G_s$ that:
	$$
		d(G_s,M) = (2s-2)d(G,M^*).
	$$
\end{observation}
Graph $G_s$ consisted two cliques $K_s$ and bridge between. On next picture painted example of graph $G_s$ for $s=4$.

As can be seen from the picture $2$, $d(G_4, M^*) = 1$, $d(G_4, M) = 6$ (in case , where on Step 1 in first iteration algorithm $A_2$ choosing vertex $1$ and on step $3$ - vertex $2$) and equality $(2)$ have done.
Obviously, that for any $s d(G_s,M^*) = 1)$. In worst case cluster graph $M$ for $G_s$ fund by algorithm $A_2$, consisted from clique $K_2$ and two cliques $K_{s-1}$. Therefore $d(G_s,M = 2)$
